One of the big catch words of our day concerning the Bible is 'inerrancy'. This word describes the nature of the Bible, and for many, an important deciding factor of an evangelical. It is a very modern and American concept that doesn't concern other parts of Christianity, though they deal with the same concerns and concepts.

## What does Inerrancy Mean?

Before digging into this topic, it is important to first define what 'inerrancy' means. The major problem with this task is rectifying its varied use with its definition in the dictionary. The dictionary definition says that something that is inerrant contains no errors. However, many use this term as a statement for the Bible's nature, not content. There is a similarly rellated word, 'infallible'. The dictionary definition of 'infallible' is incapable of error.

So, when someone says the Bible is inerrant and infallible, are they being redundant, or is there a good reason to include both? Or, are those championing inerrancy just playing a word game?

Looking to the Chicago Statement on Inerrancy, we can see the nuanced nature of these terms and how they are used.

## The Chicago Statement

The Chicago Statement on Inerrancy definitely has its problems. However, it was written in a specific time for a specific reason. The church faced an interesting battle in the 70's. With supreme court cases ruling on teaching evolution in schools and the rise of more critical Biblical scholarship, many within evangelicalism were faced with the decision to either fall in line, or take a stand. The Chicago statement is one key response to these rising issues. As a result, many of the articles within the statement are tailored to address these issues, while at the same time creating a general Biblical statment.

In the document there are many uses of the two terms 'infallible' and 'inerrant'. The document states that the Bible holds both of these qualities at the same time and that these qualities are distinct but are co-dependant.

I see the point of using the term inerrant as taking an argument forward. Basically, not just leaving the conclusion of infallibility un-said. The writers and signers of the Chicago statement wanted to be absolutely clear that the Bible not only is unable to contain error, but in fact it does not contain any error.

## Does it Matter?

Looking back on this statement, I agree with the conclusions drawn by it. Yet, I disagree with how it was described. First of all, it takes longer than three days to think about and then express a complex issue like the nature of the Bible. While I'm sure that both the signers and writers had thought about the topic long before the conference, this is something that takes time to develop.

So, does it matter if the Bible is inerrant? Did the Chicago statement aptly do what it set out to do?

No question inerrancy matters. If the Bible contains errors, our faith would be in question. However, I think each generation needs its own statement. Ideas develop over time. The implications of trends and movements are played out and hindsight sets in. Is all progress good? No, definitely not, but building upon what has been said before to better express the complex nature of the Bible is still necessary, even if it adds more 'nuance'.
