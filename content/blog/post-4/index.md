description: "A thought experiment concerning canonization"

Every now and again, it is fun to play devil's advocate. In this post, we will do just that. Below, I will argue for including an extra Biblical book into the canon and for excluding a Biblical book from the canon. We won't go into as much detail as we could for each section, but it should be a fun exercise nonetheless. The goal is to think about the reasoning behind including some books into the canon and why to exclude others.

## 1 Enoch

1 Enoch is a pseudepigraphal work that talks about Enoch, seventh from Adam, and his ascent into heaven to see the cosmos and what is to come. Below are a few reasons to include it into the canon.

- Probably the biggest reason is that it is quoted by Jude who considers it prophecy. Yes Paul quotes non-biblical works and just because a book of the Bible quotes something doesn't mean that the source of the quote should be in the canon. Yet, Jude says, 'Enoch, seventh from Adam, prophesied'. This is more than a mere quote, but an assertion that the book is prophecy.
- Less convincing, but still valuable, it is highly regarded by early Judaism. The Dead Sea Scrolls contain many manuscripts of 1 Enoch, more than most other Biblical books. This shows the influence it had among early Jews like Jude.
- Lastly, 1 Enoch explains many of the mysteries we find in Genesis. It gives explanation to the Sons of God and the Nephilim as well as basic ideas concerning heaven, angels, the afterlife, and eschatology. This is probably the explanation for being quoted by Jude and being highly regarded by early Jews.

## Jude

The book of Jude is a very short letter written by Jesus's brother. That fact alone would make most believe that it should be in the Bible, but here are a few reasons to exclude it from the canon.

- It quotes 1 Enoch and other extra Biblical works. 1 Enoch is clearly not written by Enoch 7th from Adam. Meaning Jude is either deceived or is claiming false information when he says 'Enoch, seventh from Adam, prophesied'. He also includes reference to the Assumption of Moses. While not found in any extant form, the Assumption of Moses makes claims to Biblical events involving Moses, his death and being taken to heaven. Including Jude is a detriment to the integrity of Scripture.
- Aside from quoting extra Biblical works, the contents are not helpful for Christians. Sure, Jude encourages staying faithful in the midst of trial, but other Biblical books have this. Beyond the encouragement, Jude creates more questions than it answers. How can we blaspheme the glorious ones and why is that important? Why are angels bound in the earth?
- Lastly, 2 Peter quotes Jude almost ver batim. If we really need the content of Jude, then we can already see it in 2 Peter. Also, maybe Jude just copied 2 Peter when he wrote the letter.

## Conclusion

I obviously shaded each case the way I wanted to. Don't believe that these are reasons enough to be convinced. Again, this was just a thought experiment, and I hope it showed the complexities of considering the process of canonization.
