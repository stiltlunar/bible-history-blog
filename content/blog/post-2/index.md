In our day and age with the ability to mass print books, we sometimes forget the painstaking task of producing and maintaining writings in the past. The Gutenberg printing press, a revolution in the Western production of books, was only first invented less than 600 years ago. The oldest books of the Bible, in comparison, have been around for possibly 3,000 years. So, for nearly 95% of the existence of the Bible, the individual books were composed and transmitted through other means than moveable type.

The implications of this are far reaching. The form of the writing also plays a large role in the capacity of the writing. For the majority of its existence, the Bible was kept in distinct books or collections. This can be seen in the existence of the phrase 'The Book of the Twelve' which refers to the 12 minor prophets, all of which could fit on a single scroll or 'book'.

In light of this, I think it would be a good exercise to look at different ancient writing techniques. We won't be able to examine all the possible writing techniques or will we be able to explain the ones we do examine in full detail, but a broad overview is still helpful.

## Writing in Stone

The most ancient form of writing that we will examine is writing on stone. Many examples of stone engraving come to mind right off the bat. The Code of Hammurapi and the Rosetta Stone are significant stone inscriptions. The Ten Commandments are a prominent Biblical example.

To write on stone, the stone would first have to be prepared, smoothed out, and possibly covered in lime to offer a better backdrop for chiseling. After this, the scribe would take an iron stylus and chisel away the inscription.

Writings in stone lasted for a long time, but they were not very portable. This leads us to the use of clay tablets.

## Clay Tablets

Clay tablets were more portable than stone, but still very durable. A scribe would take soft clay, use a stylus to imprint the writing, and then fire the clay in a kiln to harden it.

Though more portable than stone, clay was still heavy, especially with longer pieces of writing. Some clay writings took the form of a cylinder where a wooden dowel would be driven through the center and read by rotating the cylinder.

Clay tablets were also a common way for new scribes to practice. Taking a round loaf like tablet, the teacher would write something on one side of the tablet, and the student would try to accurately recreate it on the other side.

## Papyrus

Papyrus is a reed like plant that grows natively to the Nile in Egypt. Taking this reed, the Egyptians sliced the plant into small strips. After creating the strips they would soak them in water for a few days to soften them. Once soaked, the strips were then laid out in a criss cross pattern and placed under heavy rocks of pots. This would allow the natural sugars in the plant to adhere together forming a tight bond. The end product was a thin, paper like material (confusingly, also called papyrus) that was very conducive to writing.

Papyrus, though not as durable, was very portable and became the most common material for writing.

## Wax Tablets

One of the more interesting materials to write on were wax tablets. These were not intended to be long lasting writings. They would take a flat piece of slate or wood and place a layer of wax on the surface of it. Then, using a stylus, one could cut into the wax to form letters. If they wanted to, they could melt the wax, or run a smooth bar across to 'erase' the writing.

Wax tablets were very useful for recording simple notes or for scribes to practice on.

## Conclusion

Writing has been around for a long time. The technology may have evolved over time, but the purpose has stayed the same since the beginning. As an experiment, imagine not being able to use a computer, pen, or paper. Using anything else in your house or back yard besides these items, come up with a way to write messages. Ask, 'How long will this message last?', 'Is this something that would be easy to reporduce?', 'How much would it cost to do this on a larger scale?'
