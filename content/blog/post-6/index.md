description: "Looking at different philosophies of translation"

Translation philosophies are a dime a dozen. Each translation has their own approach which justifies why they exist in the first place. There are many catch phrases for each philosophy, like 'Formal Equivalency' and 'Functional Equivalency', but to claim that one is 'better' than another or even 'more accurate' is to misunderstand the situation.

## What is Formal and Functional Equivalency?

Formal and functional equivalency are typically pitted against each other as opposite ends of the translation spectrum. Formal equivalency strives to accurately translate each word as it is used in the original language, as well as maintain the order of thoughts and words as they appear in the original. It is typically understood as a 'word for word' philosophy. On the opposite side, functional equivalency strives to make the meaning clear in the target language. An extreme example is to translate ancient measurements and currency into their modern day equivalents. Functional equivalency is typically called a 'thought for thought' philosphy. Despite these goals, neither philosophy can be applied to every passage equally and at the same time maintain full respect of the original and offer a clear, comprehensive, neutral (or without interpretation) translation into the target language.

## Why these Descriptions are Not Fully Accurate

Let me illustrate this with an example.

In Hebrew there is a common collection of idioms all having to do with the nose or face. Exodus 34:6 is an example. Here, Moses declares God 'long of nose'. You won't see this in any translation, and for a very good reason, it makes absolutely no sense to us. To say that someone had a long nose, was to say that they took a long time for their anger to rise. The opposite is also true, someone with a short nose was easily angered. This is different than having a single word mean many different things. For example, "He is a fan" vs "Turn on the fan". 'Fan' refers to two different ideas. Formal equivalency accounts for this difference by trying to use the same word in both instances (though it is not always possible). The example in Exodus 34:6, completely ignores the clear meaning of the word and typically translates the phrase as 'slow to anger'.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just illustrates the difference between languages.

## My Philosophy: "What's the Situation?"

The differences in language is a big hurdle when working on a translation. I think the best approach is assessing the situation and molding the philosophy to that without changing the original meaning.

Let's take a team of missionaries that are translating the Bible into a language for a remote tribe that doesn't already have a translation, or even written language. The situation probably has the following factors:

- The Believers, if there are any, are probably young believers and need maturing
- The language istelf hasn't been fully worked out with a proper 'grammar'
- Academic or advanced theological (or Western ideas) questions are probably not at the forefront of their minds

Given this situation, I think it would be appropriate to create a translation similar to the New Living Translation for English. The basic meaning of the Bible needs to be conveyed and the original word usage and structure will need to give way to conveyance of meaning.

However, the translation work should not stop there. As the believers mature, a new translation that focuses on coveying the more technical nature of the faith, especially retaining words and structure that is apparant for Academic and advance theological topics, will need to be made.

## Conclusion

The translation process is complicated. There will never be a 'perfect' translation and language will continue to evolve. As a result, the translation process will need to adapt and grow just as languages do.
