If you have been around the American Church world long enough, you will know that translations can be a very personal thing. Just looking at the KJV only movement it is clear that people can get very defensive about their translation decisions. KJV Onlyers aren't the only ones though. There will always be those claiming that their translation is the 'best' or 'most accurate'. Though there are definitely 'bad' translations, the major english versions are very good. To be sure, they each have their pros and cons, but if each are good in most areas and each have their down sides, should we claim a single translation as our 'daily driver', or should we use many different translations?

## Should we have a 'Personal' Translation?

I am a big proponent of reading multiple translations, especially if you cannot read Greek or Hebrew. Doing so allows you to see the variation in possible translation options. Not only this, but reading multiple translations will allow you to get a clearer picture of what is actually being said. Similar to a dictionary having multiple examples of how a word is used in a sentence, reading multiple translations better pinpoints what the 'original' is getting at.

On the flip side, there are many practical reasons for sticking with a single translation in your daily use.

1. You become familiar with the nuances of a single translation (i.e. when it says 'and then', it typically means there is a thematic break).
2. Memorizing scripture in a single translation is easier for practice and recall.
3. Sticking with a single translation typically means sticking with a single physical copy, allowing you to easily locate specific passages.

It's for these reasons that I recommend the following:

- When you are studying a specific passage or book, read multiple translations. Reading through a book you are studying in multiple translations is very helpful when outlining the book and getting a sense of the overall meaning.
- When you are doing any long reading (i.e. if you are doing a 'read the Bible in a year' program) stick to a single translation.
- When you are memorizing Scripture, stick to a single translation.

## Which Translation Should I Choose?

Choosing a translation is a very personal decision. The first step is to ask yourself what you want in a translation. Each person's desires are different, but be careful not to make this process about finding the 'end all, be all' translation. You may change your mind years from now, and that's ok.

Here are some things to consider when picking a translation.

### What Translation Do Others Around Me Use?

Your individualistic nature may be saying, 'why should I care what others are reading if this is *my* decision?' Well, if everyone around you is reading a single translation, interacting with them and discussing the Bible becomes easier when you are also using the same translation. You won't have to do reading gymnastics in Sunday School when the one person is reading the old King James while you are reading the New Living Translation.

The answer to this holds different weight for different situations. If you are in a group or at a church that uses a lot of different translations, then it is less important. However, if everyone is using ESV, unless you have strong reasons to choose a different translation, you may just stick to ESV.

### What Translation Philosophy does this Translation Use?

One of the main reasons we have different translations is due to differing translation philosophies. Some translators prefer 'formal equivalence' or 'functional equivalence' in how they approach translating the Bible, while others try to strike a balance. I have hesitations picking a translation based on these catch phrases (refer to my previous posts on language and translation philosophy to see why), but it is important to understand the motivation of the translators. One motivation is not necessarily 'better' than another, but you may prefer having a translation closer to the 'original' word structure or usage, yet others may prefer a 'thought for thought' translation.

### Can I read this?

I've heard stories where a believer wants to read the King James Version because of its poetic and regal nature, but they can't remember if thy means yours or mine. Beauty definitely has its place, but understanding what is being said is more important.

This is why I recommend using the New Living Translation for children, and something like the NIV or ESV for adults who are new believers. "Can I understand this?", is probably the most important question to ask yourself when choosing a translation.

### Other Questions

There are more questions to consider when picking a translation, but these three are what I consider to be the most important. You will need to ask yourself what your priorities are, write them down, and then choose the translation that checks the most boxes. Remember, no translation is perfect.

## What I Use

Personally I've gone back and forth on which translation I use. I used to be a stickler for the New American Standard Bible because it was the 'most accurate' and 'most academic'. I have since changed my mind on a lot of these convictions.

Right now I am using the ESV as my 'daily driver' and I chose this mostly because of question number 1, but here is my full reasoning:

- Most believers *I* know use the ESV so it allows me to be familiar with it
- I generally agree with the translation choices of specific passages
- It's fairly easy English to read

This decision wasn't too complicated for me, but my situation is different than yours. I have access to multiple translations and can make my way through a passage in Greek and Hebrew. Not everyone is in the same situation, nor should they be.

Let me know what you think. Comment below on what translation you use and why? Have you ever changed the translation you use?
