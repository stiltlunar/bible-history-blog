## Introduction

What comes to mind when you hear the word 'confession'? You may get an image of someone sitting in a booth talking to a priest or of an interrogation room where the interrogator attempts to make someone confess to a crime.

## What is a Confession?

For the sake of this post, a confession is what we confess to be true, or what we believe. Christians have had confessions since the very beginning of the church. Some claim that Paul's letter to the Philippians contains a hymn in chapter 2 that was sung in the churches as a confession. The Nicene Creed, adopted in 325 A.D., is still recited in many churches today. As the church grew and changed over time, so did the confessions. Nowadays you can find a confession about almost any belief.

## Example Confessions

Let's take a look at a few confessions about the Bible. As we do, let's ask these questions:

1. Does this talk about the contents of the Bible?
2. Does this talk about the transmission of the Bible?
3. Does this talk about the translation of the Bible?
4. What does this say about the nature of the Bible?
5. What does this say about the source of the Bible?

### Baptist Faith and Message

The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God’s revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.[^1]

### Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod

We teach that the Holy Scriptures differ from all other books in the world in that they are the Word of God. They are the Word of God because the holy men of God who wrote the Scriptures wrote only that which the Holy Ghost communicated to them by inspiration, 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21. We teach also that the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures is not a so‐called "theological deduction," but that it is taught by direct statements of the Scriptures, 2 Tim. 3:16, John 10:35, Rom. 3:2; 1 Cor. 2:13. Since the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, it goes without saying that they contain no errors or contradictions, but that they are in all their parts and words the infallible truth, also in those parts which treat of historical, geographical, and other secular matters, John 10:35.

We furthermore teach regarding the Holy Scriptures that they are given by God to the Christian Church for the foundation of faith, Eph. 2:20. Hence the Holy Scriptures are the sole source from which all doctrines proclaimed in the Christian Church must be taken and therefore, too, the sole rule and norm by which all teachers and doctrines must be examined and judged. ‐‐ With the Confessions of our Church we teach also that the "rule of faith" (analogia fidei) according to which the Holy Scriptures are to be understood are the clear passages of the Scriptures themselves which set forth the individual doctrines. (Apology. Triglot, p. 441, Paragraph 60; Mueller, p. 684). The rule of faith is not the man‐made so‐called "totality of Scripture" ("Ganzes der Schrift").

We reject the doctrine which under the name of science has gained wide popularity in the Church of our day that Holy Scripture is not in all its parts the Word of God, but in part the Word of God and in part the word of man and hence does, or at least, might contain error. We reject this erroneous doctrine as horrible and blasphemous, since it flatly contradicts Christ and His holy apostles, set up men as judges over the Word of God, and thus overthrows the foundation of the Christian Church and its faith.[^2]

### United Methodist Handbook Concerning the Bible

We say that the Bible is vital to our faith and life, but what exactly is the Bible? Here are four ways to view it:
A library

The Bible is a collection of sixty-six books, thirty-nine in the Old Testament (or Hebrew Bible) and twenty-seven in the New Testament. These books were written over a one-thousand-year period in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic (the language Jesus spoke), and Greek.

The books are of different lengths and different literary styles. In the Hebrew Bible we find legends, histories, liturgies for community worship, songs, proverbs, sermons, even a poetic drama (Job). In the New Testament are Gospels, a history, many letters, and an apocalypse (Revelation). Yet through it all the Bible is the story of the one God, who stands in a covenant relationship with the people of God.
Sacred Scripture

In early times and over many generations, the sixty-six books were thoughtfully used by faithful people. In the process their merits were weighed, and the community of believers finally gave them special authority. Tested by faith, proven by experience, these books have become sacred; they've become our rule for faith and practice.

In Israel the Book of Deuteronomy was adopted as the Word of God about 621 B.C. The Torah, or Law (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible), assumed authority around 400 B.C.; the Prophets about 200 B.C.; and the Writings about 100 B.C. After a struggle the Christians determined that the Hebrew Bible was Scripture for them as well. The New Testament as we know it was formed and adopted by church councils between A.D. 200 and A.D. 400.
God speaking to us about salvation

We say that God speaks to us through the Bible and that it contains all things necessary for salvation. This authority derives from three sources:

    We hold that the writers of the Bible were inspired by God, that they were filled with God's Spirit as they wrote the truth to the best of their knowledge.
    We hold that God was at work in the process of canonization, during which only the most faithful and useful books were adopted as Scripture.
    We hold that the Holy Spirit works today in our thoughtful study of the Scriptures, especially as we study them together, seeking to relate the old words to life's present realities.

The Bible's authority is, therefore, nothing magical. For example, we do not open the text at random to discover God's will. The authority of Scripture derives from the movement of God's Spirit in times past and in our reading of it today.
A guide to faith and life

We United Methodists put the Bible to work. In congregational worship we read from the Bible. Through preaching, we interpret its message for our lives. It forms the background of most of our hymns and liturgy. It's the foundation of our church school curriculum. Many of us use it in our individual devotional lives, praying through its implications day by day. However, we admit that there's still vast "biblical illiteracy" in our denomination. We need to help one another open the Bible and use it.

Perhaps the Bible is best put to use when we seriously answer these four questions about a given text: (1) What did this passage mean to its original hearers? (2) What part does it play in the Bible's total witness? (3) What does God seem to be saying to my life, my community, my world, through this passage? and (4) What changes should I consider making as a result of my study?[^3]

1. Does this talk about the contents of the Bible?
   - 66 Books
   - 39 Books in Old Testament
   - 27 Books in New Testament
   - Written in three different languages
   - Contains different genres
2. Does this talk about the transmission of the Bible?
   - Nothing on transmission
3. Does this talk about the translation of the Bible?
   - Doesn't mention translation
4. What does this say about the nature of the Bible?
   - Authoritative
5. What does this say about the source of the Bible?
   - Writers were inspired
   - Written to the best of the writer's knowledge
   - God worked through canonization

## Why Start Here?

You may be asking, 'if this is a bible history blog, why start with a post on confessions?' While the purpose of this blog is to talk about the Bible as a 'document', it is important to not separate the history and details from faith. We will be asking (and hopefully, answering) questions like: how did we get the bible?, how was it passed down through time?, how was it translated into different languages and why? As we explore these questions we may come across something we haven't thought about before. There may be times where you will think, 'what should I believe as a result of this information?' It's because of this that I think it is important to start with confessions. We can use confessions as a starting point to help us begin thinking about the Bible, and as a measuring stick for how we have grown.

### A Little Exercise

As an exercise, write down what you believe about the Bible (your personal confession). This can be a one sentence, super simple statement, or multiple paragraphs. It's up to you. For time's sake, let's keep it to about one page though. You don't need to do any research for this, but you can reference or copy a confession above or one from your church or denomination if you'd like. All right, go ahead and write this down (or type it out) and then come back.

Well, what did you learn? Was this easy? Did you have to think about this for a long time? Do you have more questions now than when you started?

Now that you have this written down, hold on to it. If you continue reading this blog, look back at this from time to time and update it as you go. That's right, update it! A confession is never static. As we grow and learn more, our beliefs about the world should change. Even historical and denominational confessions change. The Nicene Creed was ammended less than 60 years after it was adopted. The Baptist Faith and Message has changed multiple times in the last hundred years. These changes aren't necessarily like, 'I thought this was true then, but now I don't think it is', but, probably more common, 'I still believe this, but there is more to it.'

## My Current 'Working' Confession

The Bible is a collection of 66 books divided into two 'testaments'. The Old Testament contains 39 books and the New Testament contains 27 books (list below).

The Old Tesament was written in Hebrew with a small portion written in Aramaic. The New Testament is written in Greek. The books themselves were written at different points in time and passed down either individually or in their respective collections until eventually being canonized into one collection called the Bible.

The Bible has been translated into many different languages. These translations retain the nature of the original languages in as much as they retain the original meaning and at the same time convey this meaning accurately into the target language.

The Bible as a whole is a collection of divine works inspired by God, written by men, for the purpose of revealing God's anointed Messiah and Son, Jesus, providing instruction for believers on how to live their lives wisely, and information concerning the history of God's involvment with his nation Israel and his Church.
