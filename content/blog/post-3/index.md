description: "Exploring Old Testament extra Biblical works"

If you're an evangelical, extra Biblical books are always a controversial topic and a magnet to those who are a little rebellious/skeptical. When I first encountered them, I was confused as to what they were, how they were organized and why their names changed. Well, hopefully this post will help you make sense of them. There are two main categories of extra Biblical works and they go by different names. The first is the Apocrypha; these are Old Testament books that are rejected by protestants. This collection is also called the Deuterocanon (second canon, best thought of as 'secondary' canon) by those who accept them as scripture. We will get into the specifics of these later. The second category is Pseudepigrapha. These are books that are not considered scripture (with one or two exceptions) by any orthodox group. The name 'Pseudepigrapha' implies that the authors who wrote them were claiming to be someone they weren't. The typical reason for this is not necessarily to deceive, but to gain more credibility by claiming to be someone important. Unfortunately, not all books in the Pseudepigrapha are claimed to be written by someone else, making the title of the category a bit of a misnomer. It has instead been more of a catch all category.

The history of the Apocrypha is long and cumbersome. I discuss it below, but just know that this is a very broad overview.

Around 400-300 BC there began a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. This translation took time and a definitive Greek 'Bible' was not a concept until much later. Instead, each book was separate, but collected together into groups (called collections). This event led to the formation of two traditions, the Greek Old Testament and the Hebrew/Aramaic Old Testament. Many Jews of the time used the Greek since they were spread out accross the entire empire and did not speak Hebrew any more. The Jews in Palestine, however, retained the Hebrew/Aramaic Old Testament.

As time went on, the Greek OT tradition gained a few books and additions to already existing books. These were highly regarded by those who used the Greek OT. Because these additions were written in Greek, their inclusion into the Hebrew tradition either never happened, or was not widely accepted. When Jerome made his translation of the Bible into Latin, he included these additions as an appendix because they were so loved by many Christians. Jerome's translation, the Vulgate, became THE Bible of the church for almost 1,000 years (that's almost half of the existence of the church!). Then a major change happened during the reformation.

The reformers, trying to get back to a 'purer' christianity, rejected the books from found in the Vulgate's appendix from the canon because they were not found in the original Hebrew collection of the Old Testament. This didn't mean that they thought these were bad, just that they were not scripture.

This covers the Western church and the Apocryphal books, but there is more history related to the Greek Orthodox and Slavonic churches. Here is a list found in the New Oxford Annotated Apocrypha

Roman Catholic

- Tobit
- Judith
- Additions to Esther
- Widsom of Solomon
- Ecclesiasticus/Wisdom of Jesus, Son of Sirach/Sirach/Ben Sira
- Baruch
- The Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch ch 6)
- Additions to Daniel
  - The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Jews
  - Susanna
  - Bel and the Dragon
- 1 Maccabees
- 2 Maccabees

Greek and Slavonic not in Roman Catholic

- 1 Esdras (2 Esdras in Slavonic, 3 Esdras in Vulgate)
- Prayer of Mannaseh
- Psalm 151
- 3 Maccabees

Slavonic and Vulgate

- 2 Esdras (3 Esdras in Slavonic, 4 Esdras in Vulgate)
  - Ezra-Nehemiah are 1 and 2 Esdras in the Vulgate and 1 Esdras in Slavonic

Looking at the Pseudepigrapha, there is not a defined list that encapsulates everything. So, generally speaking, it is a catch all category that contains early Jewish works not accepted into the canon and not a part of the Apocrypha. Some famous books in this list are 1 Enoch, Jubilees, and the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs. 1 Enoch is especially interesting because it is accepted as scripture by the Ethiopian church and is quoted by Jude in the New Testament.

The discussion of extra biblical works raises a very important question, what is the canon? I think there is a tendency to think that the canon has been a static entity throughout history; the problem is the canon has been varied throughout time. From a theological perspective, it is simple to say that there is a single collection of books that are inspired. The problem is, we don't have a list directly from God. The result is a messy history of the Church figuring out what scripture actually includes.

This makes it seem as though every book is subject to questioning; this is far from the truth. Outside of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, the books in the Bible have remained consistent very early on in church history. Looking at Jerome, he admits that the Apocrypha is not 'part of the Bible', but included it (as an appendix) because they were valuable to early Christians.

I'll leave you with these final thoughts. We consider many books outside of the Bible, written by modern people, to be valuable and we hold them in high regard; in fact, we order our lives by some (political documents such as the constitution, self development and medicinal books as well). The Bible is God's written self revelation. While other books are valuable, they are not communication from the creator of the universe. Though other books hold truth, they are not the guiding force and explanation of human existence. If you are a Christian, the Bible is scripture because you believe these statements are true to reality.
