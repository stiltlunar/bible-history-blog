# Confessions and the Bible

## Introduction

What comes to mind when you hear the word 'confession'? You may get an image of someone sitting in a booth talking to a priest or of an interrogation room where the interrogator attempts to make someone confess to a crime.

## What is a Confession?

For the sake of this post, a confession is what we confess to be true, or what we believe. Christians have had confessions since the very beginning of the church. Some claim that Paul's letter to the Philippians contains a hymn in chapter 2 that was sung in the churches. This hymn would have acted as a kind of confession for the church. The Nicene Creed, adopted in 325 A.D., is still recited in many churches today. As the church grew and changed over time, so did the confessions. Nowadays you can find a confession about almost any belief.

There are many confessions on the Bible itself. The development of these came a little later than other confessions, though people wrote about their beliefs about the Bible from early on.

## Example Confessions

Let's take a look at a few confessions about the Bible. As we do, ask these questions:

- Does this talk about the contents of the Bible?
- Does this talk about the transmission of the Bible?
- Does this talk about the translation of the Bible?
- What does this say about the nature of the Bible?
- What does this say about the source of the Bible?

## Why Start Here?

You may be asking, 'if this is a bible history blog, why start with a post on confessions?' While the purpose of this blog is to talk about the Bible as a 'document', it is important to not separate the history and details from our faith. We will be asking (and hopefully, answering) questions like: how did we get the bible?, how was it passed down through time?, how was it translated into different languages and why? As we explore these questions we may come across something we haven't thought about before. There may be times where you will think, 'what should I believe as a result of this information?' It's because of this that I think it is important to start with confessions. We can use confessions as a starting point to help us begin thinking about the Bible, and as a measuring stick for how we have grown.

### A Little Exercise

As an exercise, write down what you believe about the Bible (your personal confession). This can be a one sentence, super simple statement, or multiple paragraphs. It's up to you. For time's sake, let's keep it to about one page though. You don't need to do any research for this, but you can reference or copy a confession above or one from your church or denomination if you'd like. All right, go ahead and write this down (or type it out) and then come back.

Well, what did you learn? Was this easy? Did you have to think about this for a long time? Do you have more questions now than when you started?

Now that you have this written down, hold on to it. If you continue reading this blog, look back at this from time to time and update it as you go. That's right, update it! A confession is never static. As we grow and learn more, our beliefs about the world should change. Even historical and denominational confessions change. The Nicene Creed was ammended less than 60 years after it was adopted. The Baptist Faith and Message has changed multiple times in the last hundred years. These changes aren't necessarily like, 'I thought this was true then, but now I don't think it is', but, probably more common, 'I still believe this, but there is more to it.'
